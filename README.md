Module 3 Challenge - Python

## Before You Begin
Before starting the assignment, be sure to complete the following steps:

- Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge. Do not add this homework assignment to an existing repository.

- Clone the new repository to your computer.

- Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.

- In each folder that you just created, add the following content:

    - A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

    - A Resources folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure that your script has the correct path to the CSV file.

    - An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

- Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.

Create a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Analyze the records to calculate each of the following values:

-The total number of months included in the dataset

-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### Instructions
This means to helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

A comma-separated value file called election_data.csv. The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote
